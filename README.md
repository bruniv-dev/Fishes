# Fishes

Three Fish Login Page This project features a visually engaging login page themed around the aquatic environment of fish. The page incorporates HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and CSS animations to bring the fish to life, creating an interactive and appealing user experience. Note that this is a frontend-only implementation as of now.

Key Features:

Aquatic Themed Design: The page is styled with a blue gradient background, reminiscent of underwater scenery.

Animated Fish: CSS animations make three fish swim in a wave-like pattern, adding a dynamic visual element. Each fish swims at different speeds and positions to create a lively scene.

Bubbles Animation: Bubbles rise to the surface at varying speeds, adding to the underwater atmosphere.

Login Form: A user-friendly login form is included on the right side of the page, with inputs for email and password, "Remember Me" functionality, and links for forgotten passwords and account creation.

Interactive Elements: Buttons for Google, complete with hover effects, enhance the interactive experience.

Aquatic Plants: Imaginary aquatic plants are subtly incorporated into the design, enhancing the underwater ambiance.
